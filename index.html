        <div id="aboutme">
            <p>
                I graduated as an interior designer
            </p>
            <p>
                I used to work as a chef, but my work stopped since the Covid-19 crisis, so I decided to work on my hobbies, one of which is Java and Python programming. I am lucky to find you guys and I am proud to join you
            And one of my hobbies is also drawing. But I stopped to devote myself to lectures now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm excited about the upcoming lessons because I felt emptied out during the vacation and can't wait to get started. with all of you.

            <p>
                I hope to gain more knowledge and to grow in my career level to be one of the best in the tech industry. Am seeking to learn more and make new achievements that one day history will talk about.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
                I have always dreamed of being in the tech industry but I had some difficult circumstances in the past letting me delay achieving my dream. But as i always say its never too late to do what you love and what you are passionate about. However, no matter what a person might pass through he could still make it happen and during Covid 19 i lost my job and made me realize maybe its time for a change and i started taking courses and then had this great opportunity to pursue my long lasting dream. It is even better than a cinderella story.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The main why is because ever since i saw the movie of silicon valley i thought why not me having a movie about me and I was just 10 years old then. I tried to pursue my dream but the financials werent good and I just want to make a difference and make my parents proud.
